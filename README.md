# Possessed!!

Hack Idea for [Sports Tech Hack Day](https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/sportstech-hack-day)



## Summary

- Display stats (possessions, players) of last 5 min of 2012 Mar 13th Man City vs QPR Premier League Winning Moment
- Clicking a stat figure plays back to the exact moment.

The name came from my attempt to visualising the "game possession". However, I played youtube video more than 100 times while working on this, and I was literally "like a man possessed"

## Todo

- Skip for only the key stats you are interested (eg: Man city possessed, Mario, etc)
